# The PluginInfo class is instantiated in each Concerto Plugin

# The methods provide below provide a two-way API: a set of
# methods to be called within the Engine class to configure
# callbacks and the like; and a set of methods to be called
# by the ConcertoPlugin model when interfacing to the rest of
# the Concerto application.
