# To update or deploy using capistrano:
#
# To deploy from/to the concerto vm image:
# 1. First, you have to run the prepvm_for_capistrano.sh script on the concerto server.  This is a one-time install
#    that makes sure the environment is setup to deploy using capistrano and to receive deploys via capistrano.  More
#    information is provided when you run the script.
# 2. Anytime you want to update, log into the concerto server as the concerto user and run:
#      cd ~/projects/concerto
#      cap deploy
#    You are now up and running on the latest (official) version.  If you want the bleeding edge development
#    version, run cap -S branch="master" deploy
#
# To deploy to another server:
# 1. Make sure the role :web, :app, and :db servers are set to your actual servers (below).
# 2. Make sure the :deploy_to path points to your actual deploy location.
# 3. If you need to, make sure the :user (used for ssh) is set appropriately or comment it out.
# 4. If you are running the site under a subdirectory instead of at the root of the web server then
#    uncomment the :asset_env line and make sure the RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT is set appropriately.
# 5. Run: cap deploy:setup && cap deploy:check
# 6. Run: cap deploy                <=== this is all you need for subsequent deploys
